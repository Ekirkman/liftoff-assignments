Life Hack Web-App
I had a broken seatbelt in my car. I went to youtube to try to find a fix. I watched a bunch of videos and thought it must be a faster way to find a fix for this.I needed a place where I can find a bunch or random solutions to a bunch of random problems. I came up with the idea for this web app that lets a user search for clever or unorthodox solutions to problems. The user can create a profile post, save, search, share and rate the effectiveness of lifehacks with other users.
